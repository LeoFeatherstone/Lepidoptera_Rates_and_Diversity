A few notes on taxa in the Host data that did not have a match in the 
LepIndex data, even though there are some suspicious looking potential
matches that do not seem to come up as synonyms when I google them.

1) Is "Metamorpha pulsitia" "Metamorpha elissa"?
2) Do Euriphene achlys and Euriphene plautilla have other names? There are many Euriphene species of this genus in the Lepindex data
