A fe notes on taxa in the Host data that did not have a match in the 
LepIndex data, even though there are some suspicious looking potential
matches that do not seem to come up as synonyms when I google them.

1) Is "Metamorpha pulsitia" any of "Metamorpha elissa"  or "Metamorpha pulsitia"?
2) Do Euriphene achlys and Euriphene plautilla have other names? There are many species of this genus in the Lepindex data
